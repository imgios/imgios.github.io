<h1 align="center">imgios.github.io</h1>

This repository is the :heart: of my static website, available on [giosuesulipano.it](https://giosuesulipano.it). The website is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [imgios/not-much](https://github.com/imgios/not-much) theme.

If you want to run it locally:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/imgios/imgios.github.io.git
$ hugo server -D -s ./imgios.github.io
```
