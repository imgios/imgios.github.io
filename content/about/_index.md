I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the [University of Salerno](https://www.unisa.it/), defending a thesis on the [_Implementation of an interface for displaying Relaxed Functional Dependencies_](https://github.com/imgios/bachelor-thesis).

During my studies, I became very interested in algorithms and data structures, as well as databases and software engineering. Over the past few years, I've been exploring some new topics, such as orchestration, DevOps, Kubernetes clusters, GitOps, networking, and system administration. I'm digging into these topics using a homelab I'm building at home with spare (and brand-new) hardware.

In 2018, I participated in the _Startup Weekend Caserta powered by Google for Entrepreneurs_, a 72-hour event where I built a business idea with 5 other strangers I met there. This project included activities such as several brainstorming sessions, creating a website to promote our business idea, creating and analysing end-user forms after completion, public engagement and public speaking.

Apart from IT, in my spare time I enjoy riding my motorbike to explore new places, playing video games with friends and doing sports.
