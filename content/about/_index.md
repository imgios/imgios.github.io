I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the [University of Salerno](https://www.unisa.it/), defending a thesis on the _Implementation of an interface for displaying Relaxed Functional Dependencies_.

During my studies, I became very interested in algorithms and data structures, as well as databases and software engineering. Over the past few years, I've been exploring some new topics, such as orchestration, Kubernetes clusters, and system administration. I'm digging into these topics using a homelab I'm building at home with spare (and brand-new) hardware.
